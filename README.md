# MECH105_Algorithms
All the MATLAB algorithms I made for my MECH 105 class during my Spring 2022 semester at Colorado State University
The following algorithims include functions to solve for:

*Creating a matrix that that follows various rules (read the README in the Matrices directory for more information)

*A root finding algorithm that uses False Position

*An algorithm that uses Gaussian elimination to solve for the upper triangular and lower triangular matrices

*An algorithm that uses Simpson's 1/3 Rule to solve for the integral of a given set of data and applies the Trapezoidal Rule for an odd amount of inputs

*An algorithm that can find the Linear Regression from a given set of data
