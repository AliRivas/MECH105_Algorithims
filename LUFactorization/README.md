Function format: function [L, U, P] = luFactor(A)

*Use of Gaussian elimination and pivoting to produce the lower triangular matrix and the upper triangular matrix. The matrix needs to be a square matrix or else this function won't work.*

**Inputs:**

A = coefficient matrix

**Outputs:**

L = lower triangular matrix

U = upper triangular matrix

P = the permutation matrix
